# 3DPrintingSketches
Processing sketches for creating stacks of .PNG files for 3D printing using SLA DLP

PROCESS ON INSTRUCTABLES:

BookMatteSwatch (Surface 1 - Matte)

-Prints two bricks. One is Matte, one is standard

BookMatteSwatch2 (Testing finishes and materials)

-Creates hybrid prints that are half matte and half standard

Concentric Hairball (Surface 4 - Fuzz)

-Creates concentric fuzz

Ellipses (Surface 3 - Conical)

-Creates a conical shape with matte surface noise

Gradient (Volumetric 2 - Perferation)

-Creates a moving gradient over the volume of the print that has various sized cavities for a perforated interior

GradientMatte (Surface 2 - Matte Variation)

-Creates a Matte print where pixels go from 5px to 1px throughout the print.

GradientStatic (Volumetric 2 - Perferation)

-Creates a static gradient of internal cavities for a perforated interior

Hairball (Surface 4 - Fuzz)

-Creates a grid fuzzy print

Saving Image Stacks (Rasterized image prints like Volumetric 1 - Watermarking & Volumetric-3 Weaving )

-Allows you to upload .PNG files and output as numbered slices
